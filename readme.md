# Curb Your Consumerism

Become aware of the money you're spending online.
Before you make a purchase do you ever think about the time you worked and energy put in to being able to afford it? Why does making a $10 purchase feel the same as making a $100 or $1000 purchase online?

I built this browser extension to help you raise your awareness and make more meaningful purchases. It encourages you to stop and think before you hit the purchase button by giving you a countdown relative to the size of the purchase so that there is some sense of magnitude for purchases.
